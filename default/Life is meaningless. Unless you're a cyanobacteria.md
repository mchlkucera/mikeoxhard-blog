## Content

Imagine you're a little cyanobacteria chilling in a big swamp, 3 billion years ago.
You know, just minding your own business.
Being born, living a couple weeks, chiling with your fellow cyanobacterian friends, reproducing a little, and then dying. Pretty boring right? You made no difference, and the world is the same as it was when you were born... right?

Well you have no idea that you just made humans and every complex organism, ever.
(Reasonable to not have any ideas if your capabilities include moving towards/away from light and thats about it)

By a process you might've called living (we call it photosynthesis now), you just put oxygen everywhere around, created ozone layer and made life on earth possible for plants. And for turtles. And for dinosaurs. And for humans.

So could you know what was the **meaning** of your life? I'd argue that no. Even if you had a 1200 cm³ brain.
Looks like the true "meaning" of your life was way way beyond your scope of understanding. You weren't made to know it.
Yet it was awesome! Like made-dogs-and-humans-possible type of awesome.

So (maybe) the same goes for us hoomans. It is (maybe) just beyond your understanding. You know, our life, what it means and all that stuff.
Any what do you know, someone living 3 billion years (or just months/hours) in the future will really goddamn appreciate what you are doing, right at this moment.

I would argue cyanobacterias thinking "fuck this existence! What is meaning in all of this!" wouldn't be of any benefit. Now I know we have a big brain and stuff, but I still think we have a lesson to learn from cyanobacterias. Maybe it is enough to do something interesting, maybe create something, chill around our friends & family and call it a life!
