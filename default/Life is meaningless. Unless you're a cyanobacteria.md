## Content

Imagine you're a little cyanobacteria. Chilling in a swamp. 3 billion years ago. Minding your own business - chilling around with your cyanobacterian friends, reproducing, dying. What a boring life that was. And it was all for nothing. What difference did you make in the world, huh?

Well you just made all complex life possible.
Like plants and ants and humans and stuff.

By existing you accidentally put oxygen everywhere around. Which lead to ozone being created, which lead to more complicated stuff to be created down the line.

Could you know this? Assuming you'd have a 1200 cm³ brain. Could you do a brainstorming with your team on how to make turtles exist? So that you could know you "made a difference" afterwards? Could you make a few million year long 
How could you? Photosynthesis was not your "thing". 

instead of 
So could you know what was the **meaning** of your life? I'd argue that no. Even if you had a 1200 cm³ brain.
Looks like the true "meaning" of your life was way way beyond your scope of understanding. You weren't made to know it.
Yet it was awesome! Like made-dogs-and-humans-possible type of awesome.

So (maybe) the same goes for us hoomans. It is (maybe) just beyond your understanding. You know, our life, what it means and all that stuff.
Any what do you know, someone living 3 billion years (or just months/hours) in the future will really goddamn appreciate what you are doing, right at this moment.

I would argue cyanobacterias thinking "fuck this existence! What is meaning in all of this!" wouldn't be of any benefit. Now I know we have a big brain and stuff, but I still think we have a lesson to learn from cyanobacterias. Maybe it is enough to do something interesting, maybe create something, chill around our friends & family and call it a life!
