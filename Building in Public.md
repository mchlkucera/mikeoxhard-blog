Building in public means sharing your work, learning, and progress openly - before it's perfect.

## Why It Matters
Traditional creation happens behind closed doors. You only see the polished result. But the **process** is where the real learning happens.

Benefits:
- Accountability through visibility
- Faster feedback loops
- Community learning
- Authentic connections

## How I'm Applying This
I'm starting this [[My First Note|digital garden]] to document my journey. It's messy, incomplete, and that's the point.
