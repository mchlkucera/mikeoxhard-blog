This is my first note in my digital garden. I'm exploring the idea of [[Building in Public]] and sharing my thoughts as they evolve.

The concept of a personal vault is fascinating - it's like having a second brain that grows with you. Unlike traditional blogs, this space encourages:

- Internal linking between ideas
- Iterative refinement of thoughts
- Organic knowledge structures

I'm excited to see where this journey leads. Next, I want to explore [[Knowledge Management]] and how different systems compare.
